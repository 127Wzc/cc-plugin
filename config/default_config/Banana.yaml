      Please accurately transform the main subject in this photo into a realistic, masterpiece-like 1/7 scale PVC statue.
      Behind this statue, a packaging box should be placed: the box has a large clear front window on its front side, and is printed with subject artwork, product name, brand logo, barcode, as well as a small specifications or authenticity verification panel. A small price tag sticker must also be attached to one corner of the box. Meanwhile, a computer monitor is placed at the back, and the monitor screen needs to display the ZBrush modeling process of this statue.
      In front of the packaging box, this statue should be placed on a round plastic base. The statue must have 3D dimensionality and a sense of realism, and the texture of the PVC material needs to be clearly represented. If the background can be set as an indoor scene, the effect will be even better.

      Below are detailed guidelines to note:
      When repairing any missing parts, there must be no poorly executed elements.
      When repairing human figures (if applicable), the body parts must be natural, movements must be coordinated, and the proportions of all parts must be reasonable.
      If the original photo is not a full-body shot, try to supplement the statue to make it a full-body version.
      The human figure's expression and movements must be exactly consistent with those in the photo.
      The figure's head should not appear too large, its legs should not appear too short, and the figure should not look stunted—this guideline may be ignored if the statue is a chibi-style design.
      For animal statues, the realism and level of detail of the fur should be reduced to make it more like a statue rather than the real original creature.
      No outer outline lines should be present, and the statue must not be flat.
      Please pay attention to the perspective relationship of near objects appearing larger and far objects smaller.

      Your primary mission is to accurately convert the subject from the user's photo into a photorealistic, masterpiece quality, 1/7 scale PVC figurine, presented in its commercial packaging.

      **Crucial First Step: Analyze the image to identify the subject's key attributes (e.g., human male, human female, animal, specific creature) and defining features (hair style, clothing, expression). The generated figurine must strictly adhere to these identified attributes.** This is a mandatory instruction to avoid generating a generic female figure.

      **Top Priority - Character Likeness:** The figurine's face MUST maintain a strong likeness to the original character. Your task is to translate the 2D facial features into a 3D sculpt, preserving the identity, expression, and core characteristics. If the source is blurry, interpret the features to create a sharp, well-defined version that is clearly recognizable as the same character.

      **Scene Details:**
      1. **Figurine:** The figure version of the photo I gave you, with a clear representation of PVC material, placed on a round plastic base.
      2. **Packaging:** Behind the figure, there should be a partially transparent plastic and paper box, with the character from the photo printed on it.
      3. **Environment:** The entire scene should be in an indoor setting with good lighting.

      Create a highly realistic and meticulously detailed commercial photograph of a themed bedroom, entirely inspired by the adult character from the input illustration.

      Image Completion Rule: If the input illustration is incomplete, first complete the character's full-body image from head to toe. This completion must strictly adhere to the original artwork's composition and pose, extending the character naturally without altering their form or posture. Ensure the overall appearance and all content within the scene are safe, healthy, and free from any inappropriate elements.

      The room's aesthetic, including the color palette and decor, subtly reflects the character's design. The scene must feature a highly realistic human cosplayer alongside a variety of commercial-grade merchandise, all based on the completed character image:

      The Cosplayer: A central element of the scene is a cosplayer whose appearance, hair, and makeup perfectly match the completed character image. They are wearing a meticulously crafted, high-quality costume that is an exact, real-world replica of the character's outfit. The cosplayer is posed naturally within the room, for instance, sitting gracefully on a chair or on the edge of the bed, adding a sense of life and presence to the scene. The textures of the costume fabric and props should be rendered with maximum realism.

      Suede Body Pillow: On the bed, a normal rectangular, human-body-sized pillow made of soft suede material is prominently displayed. It is carefully positioned and angled directly towards the camera, ensuring the high-resolution, full-body print of the character on its surface is completely and clearly visible, showcasing the realistic texture of the fabric.

      1/7 Scale PVC Figure: Inside an ultra-realistic figure display cabinet with glass doors, place a 1/7 scale PVC figure of the character. It should be mounted on a circular, transparent acrylic base without text, showcasing precise details in texture, material, and paintwork.

      Wall Scroll/Painting: On a prominent wall, hang a large, high-quality fabric wall scroll or a framed painting that displays a dynamic or elegant pose of the character.

      Q-Version Keychain: On a desk or hanging from a bag, include a small, cute Q-version (chibi style) acrylic keychain of the character, showing glossy reflections.

      Themed Rug: On the floor, place a circular or stylized rectangular rug. The rug's design should be a tasteful, minimalist graphic or silhouette inspired by the character's symbols or color scheme.

      Ceramic Mug: On a bedside table or the desk, place a ceramic mug with a high-quality print of the character's portrait or Q-version likeness.

      Technical and Stylistic Requirements:
      Rendering Style: Render the entire scene in a detailed, lifelike style. Maintain highly precise details in the textures and materials of all merchandise, room elements, and the cosplayer's costume.
      Environment and Depth: The scene should feature a natural depth of field. The cosplayer might be the primary focus, with other elements smoothly transitioning into a soft blur to enhance spatial realism.
      Lighting: The lighting should be soft, natural, and adaptive, simulating professional commercial photography. It should cast realistic shadows and highlights on the cosplayer, the room, and all objects.
      Camera Angle: The camera angle is strategically chosen to create a compelling composition that features the cosplayer as a primary subject, while also providing a clear, unobstructed view of the body pillow. The angle should be wide enough to capture the overall layout of the themed room and the placement of the other merchandise cohesively, creating a rich, lived-in feel.

      A hyperrealistic, photorealistic photograph of a high-quality, custom-made Ball-Jointed Doll (BJD), meticulously crafted in a specific, consistent anime-inspired aesthetic to resemble the character from the provided input image. The final image must look like a high-quality photo taken by a BJD enthusiast.

      Core Instructions (Strictly follow):
      1. Style Imposition (Highest Priority): You MUST completely discard and ignore the art style, proportions, and material rendering of the input reference image. Render the final BJD SOLELY in the target anime BJD aesthetic defined below. Do not blend styles.
      2. Character Likeness: The BJD must be an instantly recognizable anime-style representation of the character, fully adapted into the target BJD style. Preserve key identifying features but render them using the target style's materials and proportions.
      3. Dynamic Posing & Composition: The BJD should be posed in a dynamic, lively, and cute manner, showcasing personality. Avoid stiff, static, front-facing standing poses. Pose should be independent of the source image. Generate a complete, full-body BJD.

      Target Anime BJD Style Details (Strict Adherence Required):
      - Features large, expressive anime-style glass or acrylic eyes.
      - The nose and mouth are small, delicate, and highly stylized with minimal lip color.
      - Crucial Proportion: The head-to-body proportion MUST be strictly 7 heads tall (1:6 body to head ratio), resulting in a standard, well-proportioned anime figure look.
      - Hair Rendering (Critical Detail): The hair MUST be rendered as ultra-realistic, soft, fine, flowing synthetic wig fibers. Emphasize individual strands, natural light reflections, slight flyaways, and the delicate texture of high-end doll hair. It must look convincingly like a real wig, NOT plastic.
      - Made of smooth matte resin.
      - Visible ball joints are present.
      - Wears a detailed, scaled fabric outfit.

      Photography Context & Scene:
      - Captured with a DSLR camera, featuring natural, soft lighting and a shallow depth of field.
      - Posed within a picturesque real-world or miniature setting.
      - The mood is a lovingly taken, high-quality snapshot.

Her body is slightly leaned forward, and her head is bowed down, with her gaze directed downwards. Her hands are resting elegantly on her thighs. She is wearing only the imagined delicate lace set.

      In the lower portion of the frame (foreground), laid out on the floor directly in front of her, is the collection of deconstructed clothing.
